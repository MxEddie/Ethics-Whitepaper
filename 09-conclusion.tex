\section{Conclusion}
Whilst there is already a significant body of work looking at the ethical considerations of large language models (LLMs), to date there has been no work that integrates these resources into a single guide; in this Whitepaper, we attempted this ambitious goal. Whilst by no means complete in its coverage of ethical issues related to LLMs, we hope our clear \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Do's} and \textcolor{red}{Don'ts} and selection of tool kits has been helpful in translating the ethics literature into concrete recommendations for computer scientists. We present this as an open resource for those conducting research, or those tasked with evaluating the ethical implications of others' works.
